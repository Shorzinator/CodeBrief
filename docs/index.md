    # Create comprehensive bundle
    contextcraft bundle --output project-bundle.md
    ```

=== "Advanced Workflow"

    ```bash
    # Create comprehensive project context with bundle
    contextcraft bundle \
      --output complete-context.md \
      --git-log-count 15 \
      --flatten src/ tests/

    # Focused code review bundle
    contextcraft bundle \
      --exclude-deps \
      --git-full-diff \
      --flatten src/ tests/ \
      --output review-bundle.md

    # Use .llmignore for fine-grained control
    echo "*.log\n__pycache__/\n.venv/" > .llmignore
    ```
