# <center> codebrief Code of Conduct: The Art of Awesome Collaboration</center>

Welcome to codebrief! We're thrilled you're here and excited to see what amazing things we can build together. To ensure our community is a fantastic place for everyone, we've put together a few guidelines. Think of them less as "rules" and more as "recipes for a delicious collaboration stew."

## Our Pledge: Crafting a Great Experience

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and frankly, rather brilliant environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We don't care about your age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We *do* care about you being awesome to others.

We aim for a community where:
*   **Curiosity is King (or Queen, or Esteemed Non-Binary Monarch):** Ask questions! Explore ideas! We're all learning.
*   **Kindness is Cacheable:** Once you're kind, it tends to stick around and make everything run smoother.
*   **Feedback is a Feature, Not a Bug:** Constructive criticism, offered politely, helps us all improve.
*   **Wit is Welcome, Wisecracks are Weighed:** A bit of humor can lighten the load, but let's ensure it doesn't come at someone else's expense.

## Our Standards: The Ingredients for Awesome

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   **Using welcoming and inclusive language:** "Hey folks!" beats "Listen up, n00bs!" every time.
*   **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences:** We might not always agree on the best way to sort a list, but we can still be friends.
*   **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism:** "Oh, good point, I hadn't thought of that!" is a sign of strength.
*   **Focusing on what is best for the community and the project:** Sometimes your brilliant idea for a blinking text feature needs to take a backseat to accessibility.
*   **Showing empathy towards other community members:** Remember, there's a human on the other side of that screen, possibly fueled by too much coffee or too little sleep.
*   **Sharing your amazing cat photos (optional, but highly encouraged in appropriate channels).**

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances:** Keep it classy, folks.
*   **Trolling, an-cap trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks:** If your comment wouldn't make your grandma proud, maybe rethink it.
*   **Public or private harassment:** Seriously, just don't.
*   **Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission:** That's not cool, it's creepy.
*   **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting (even if our "setting" is a GitHub issue tracker at 3 AM).**
*   **Arguing about spaces vs. tabs with the intent to start a flame war.** (Okay, maybe a little lighthearted debate is fine, but you get the idea.)

## Our Responsibilities: Keeping the Stew from Spoiling

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. We're not looking to be a D&D dungeon master on a power trip, but we will keep things tidy.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. This will always be done with as much transparency as is reasonable.

## Scope: Where Does This Culinary Code Apply?

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub repository, issue tracker, pull requests, any official communication channels like Slack or Discord if they exist), and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Representing codebrief might mean using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Let's make codebrief look good everywhere!

## Enforcement: When the Souffl√© Falls Flat

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at shorz2905@gmail.com. Please don't use the public issue tracker for CoC reports.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Possible enforcement actions include:
*   A polite, private correction.
*   A public warning (if the behavior was public and mild).
*   Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces.
*   A strongly worded haiku about the importance of being excellent to each other.

## Attribution: Giving Credit Where It's Due

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1], and inspired by numerous other open-source codes of conduct that aim for a bit of personality. We also threw in a dash of our own flavor.
