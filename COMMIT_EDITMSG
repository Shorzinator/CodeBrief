feat(docs): overhaul documentation and implement CI/CD integration

This commit introduces a comprehensive overhaul of the project's documentation, aimed at providing a professional, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience. It also establishes a CI/CD pipeline for automated context generation.

Key changes include:

- **Complete Documentation Content:**
  - Created placeholder files for all planned documentation sections to resolve broken links.
  - Wrote a detailed guide for integrating ContextCraft with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

- **Professional Redesign:**
  - Removed excessive emojis and standardized the tone across all documentation for a more serious and professional feel.
  - Implemented a modern, monochrome design with a single accent color.
  - Introduced custom CSS for rounded corners, improved typography, and better layout.

- **Enhanced User Experience:**
  - Added custom JavaScript for smooth scrolling and fade-in animations.
  - Implemented a 'Copied!' confirmation for the code copy button.

- **CI/CD and Versioning:**
  - The 'docs' directory is now tracked by Git to ensure documentation is versioned alongside the code.
  - Added a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate project context on pushes and pull requests.
